# EduWeb
Welcome to the **EduWeb** website! This project focuses on student forums and e-learning resources, and XR Hub, a hub for Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) content. This project combines the static front-end design and contains only the front-end code, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No back-end or database functionality is included.

# About the Project
This project integrates the front-end for two educational platforms into one:

- Byte Learn: A static educational website that showcases sections for student forums, study aids, assignments, and edutainment resources.
- XR Hub: A static front-end website that offers AR and VR resources like videos, tutorials, and the latest trends.
  
Users can navigate between Byte Learn and XR Hub using a simple interface, but this is strictly a front-end implementation without any dynamic back-end logic.

# Features
## Byte Learn
* Static front-end design for student forums and educational resources.
* Simple navigation with responsive design.

## XR Hub
* AR and VR-related video slides and static information pages.
* Focus on visual presentation and user interaction through HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Technologies Used
1. **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the websites.
2. **CSS3**: For styling and ensuring a responsive design.
3. **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity, like navigation and multimedia support.
4. **Remixicon & FontAwesome**: Icon sets used for navigation and social links.
5. **Embedded Videos**: Static media for AR and VR content.

# Usage
- Use the Byte Learn homepage to explore static resources like student forums and study aids.
- Click "Let's Confer" to be redirected to the XR Hub section, which focuses on AR and VR.
- Browse AR and VR videos and tutorials, though note that all resources are part of the static front-end (no dynamic back-end features).
